# Movielens

This repository contains an implementation of a Java program for the MovieLens dataset, based on the task description provided at https://home.agh.edu.pl/~pszwed/wiki/doku.php?id=pz1:java-movielens.

The program is designed to import data from four CSV files that make up the dataset and store it in a database. The files contain information about movies, as well as ratings and tags given by users. In order to simulate user data that is not available in the dataset, the program uses a name generator website to automatically generate user information.

The implementation includes several Java classes that handle different aspects of the data import process, such as reading and parsing CSV files, creating and managing a database connection, and inserting data into the database.
